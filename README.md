# Time Series Analysis

## Overview

The **Time Series Analysis** project focuses on analyzing and visualizing time series data, specifically the number of airline passengers over time. This project employs various statistical techniques to decompose the time series into its components, identify trends and seasonality, and perform detrending and deseasonalization. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for forecasting and understanding patterns in time-dependent data.

## Purpose

In the field of data science, time series analysis is crucial for understanding how data points change over time. This project aims to:

- **Identify Trends**: Recognize long-term movements in the data, which can inform business strategies and operational decisions.
- **Analyze Seasonality**: Detect recurring patterns or cycles in the data, which can be essential for planning and resource allocation.
- **Forecast Future Values**: Provide a foundation for predictive modeling, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on historical data.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the time series data to identify trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components using both additive and multiplicative models.
- **Detrending and Deseasonalization**: Remove trends and seasonal effects from the data to analyze the underlying patterns.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Assess the correlation of the time series with its past values to understand the persistence of patterns over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Statsmodels**
